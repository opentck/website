<h1>openTCK</h1>
<p>
 The project <strong>openTCK</strong> aims to provide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software"><strong>free &amp; open</strong></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Compatibility_Kit" target="_blank"><strong>Technology Compatibility Kits</strong></a> for all kinds of computer languages and technologies.
</p>
<p>
 Until the project reaches a certain amount of publicity, it will focus on the <strong>Java Enterprise Edition, Version 6 (Java EE6)</strong>, by providing <a href="http://www.jboss.org/arquillian" target="_blank">Arquillian</a> tests that all vendors can freely use and test their platforms against. 
</p>
<p>
<h2>Issue reporting: Suggested workflow</h2>
<h3>Vendor -&gt; OpenTCK</h3>
<ol>
<li>A user reports a issue in the vendors issue tracker, maybe adds a testcase</li>
<li>The vendor transforms the testcase into a arquillian based testcase</li>
<li>The vendor runs the testcase using his implementation, reproducing the bug. He is now already able to look if other vendors have the same problem thanks to Arquillian</li>
<li>The vendor submits the testcase to openTCK, making it available for everyone.</li>
<li>The testcase gets integrated into the suites of testcases</li>
<li>Once per day, every vendor simply pulls from the testcases-repo and runs the testcases against their own implementation</li>
</ol>

<h3>User -&gt; OpenTCK</h3>
<ol>
<li>User encounters an issue</li>
<li>User creates testcase for the issue</li>
<li>User uploads testcase to openTCK</li>
<li>testcase gets distributed to all participating vendors</li>
<li>Vendors fix the bug</li>
<li>JavaEE just got a bit better for everyone.</li>
</ol>

<h2>why should I care?</h2>
<p>JavaEE 6 isn't perfect. Everyone working a lot with it knows that. Work for EE7 is on its way, but until then we have to stick with JavaEE 6, so we should make the best out of it.</p>
<p>Currently, only a bare minimum of tests is supplied by oracle to vendors trying to implement Java EE6 and these tests are not free.</p>
<p>Beside these tests, a huge amount of day-to-day issues come up when working with any of the implementions currently available, but those issue get lost in the various issue trackers of the different vendors which in turn make the implementations incompatible to each other, although they implement the TCK provided by Oracle.</p>
<p>Only free tests for everyone ensure that every vendor has the same chances and most importantly, the users are able to try out different implementations and stick to the one that best suites them.</p>

<h2>Why should I share? Why should I join?</h2>
<p>In my _personal_ opinion, a vendor shouldn't try to do user lock-in by harvesting testcases and protecting them like a secret, so that no other vendor can fix those issues too.</p>
<p>Vendors should compete by simply providing the best implementation, the best architecture, the best scalability and by far the best support.</p>
<p>Participating in OpenTCK is all about saying <br/><strong>&quot;I'm proud of my product!&quot;</strong> and <br/><strong>&quot;I don't fear my competitors&quot;</strong>.</p>


<h2>Plans?</h2>
<p>So what is planned for openTCK?</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to setup some Git repositories on github.com/opentck and put some basic arquillian testcases there. People could then simply fork those repos, copy the samples, and modify them to reproduce their issue. They can then run their test immediately against every pre-configured container and see if any one of them already works as expected. When finished with their testcase, they should send a pull request and their testcase will be integrated.</p>

<!-- 
<p>In the next step, I would like to setup a CI server that would run every test with every configured container and display the results in a matrix.</p>
//-->


<h2>is that all?</h2>
<p>No, it isn't, but this page is just so fresh, I just haven't had the time to write everything down.</p>
<p>Also, every single sentence here is still work in progress and I would really like you to participate with openTCK!</p>
